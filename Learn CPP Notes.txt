- Use direct-list initialization: int x { value }; for various reasons including:
    - Value Must be of type int (or whatever the data type is), or compiler will give an error (Easier to bug-fix)
      i.e. int x {4.5} will give an error, 4.5 is not an integer
    - Is the current/modern standard
    - Does not involve copying data, more effecient
    - Value initialization is of same format, i.e. x = {}; will set x to 0, thus easier to remember
    
- Can use extraction/insertion operators more than once
  - i.e. cin >> x >> y >> z; will take values seperated by spaces and put them into x, then y, then z.

- Declared variables are not initialized to any default values (unlike Java). int x; will not assing value 0 to x, x will be unassigned.

- Statements like x = 5 use the expression 5, which has the return value of 5, and side effect of assigning 5 to x.

- Can place a function below main() so long as you use forward declaration. For the function int add(int x, int y) {...}, just declare it before
  main as int add(int, int); so that main can call the actual function below it. No parameter names are required in the declaration, just types.
